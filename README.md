(1) Purpose:  The  objective  is  to  apply  the  knowledge  in  MATLAB  acquired  in  the  course 
to  create  a  game.  In  this  game,  the  player  will  launch  a  missile  to  eliminate  ten  pieces 
of  space  debris.  There  are  three  different  kinds  of  debris,  each  of  which  has  a 
different  effect  when  hit.
